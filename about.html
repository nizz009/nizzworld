			<p>Hellow Fellow Traveller! Perhaps the reason why you decided to wander through this website is either because you:
				<ol>
					<li>were interested in knowing about me, or</li>
					<li>because you are simply interested in websites.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>Either way, you are at the right place.</p>
			<p>This website aims to describe almost everything about me, starting from how I am, to how I perform my work. This website is kind of meant to be used only for work purposes so obviously I won't be mentioning stuffs like "I have 4 family members", "I love singing and dacing", etcetra.</p>
			<p>Now, for those who are here coz of their curiosity for viewing websites, then hola guys! This website, though meant for use in my work, maintains an informal tone to keep up the interest of the viewers. But the bad news is, I intend to keep this website simple (sorry to all the "cool features lovers") and accessible. So apologies if the design is too simple or boring.</p>

			<p>So ~ ! Talking about me, if I were to describe myself in one sentence, then I would say: "An enthusiastic and hard-working programmer inspired to wander different fields in the world of Information Technology."</p>
			<p>I love how programming makes your mind <em>think</em>. It's diving into a whole new world of creativity and imagination and then converting it into reality. So, no; programming isn't the boring task where you are forced to sit at one position and stare at your computer screens. In fact, for me, the world of I.T. is something filled with surprises and challenges that I always look forward to.</p>
