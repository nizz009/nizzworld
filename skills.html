      <p>Welcome! This corner of the website will be mentioning my skills and a few of my working habits that I consider as the good ones (xP).</p>
      <ul class="unordered-items">
        <li>
          <h2>Programming skills:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>C++:</h3>
                <p>The language that I currently use the most in Competitive Programming and for other purposes. I can guarantee a fair amount of practice in it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>C:</h3>
                <p>The very first programming language that I had learned and programmed with and thus it's the one I am most experienced with.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Python:</h3>
                <p>Recently started a course with it and hence, I will admit that though I can perform the basic operations, I still have cracks here and there when it comes to experience.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Others:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>HTML5 & CSS3</h3>
                <p>Both of them are the ones that I learnt recently.In fact, this website is also a practice ground for me.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Photography! <small>(not related to work, I know xP)</small></h3>
                <p>I won't consider myself as a great photographer but I do love taking pictures, especially of the things around me and the sky. In fact, as you might have guessed it already, the pictures in the page banners were all taken by me. <small>(That's one of the reasons as to why I put those in there. xD)</small></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Working habits:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Trustworthy</h3>
              <p>Yes, I won't be hacking your bank account and steal your money.<br> Anyway, keeping jokes aside, what this means is that, <strong>if I take on a job, I make sure to complete it</strong>. I hate when someone leaves his/her job incomplete and thus, I try my best not to make that same mistake myself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Can manage most of the works even with just the basics</h3>
              <p>Though I keep learning new things all the time and gain as much knowledge as possible about a particular topic, I am often creative enough to do a particular job using only the basics of the concepts required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Love experimenting</h3>
              <p>Don't worry - I am not gonna blow up a building with that habit of mine. Well, this helps me discover new things and take into account almost all the possible ways in which someone can screw up doing something and hence I avoid those and also the capabilities of a certain something which I can apply in my future projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Good sense of humor!</h3>
              <p>Why can I sense you making a "Oh really? <i>This</i> is your good sense of humor?" type of face?? Well, yes. And why is that a good thing? Well, no work becomes boring for me easily and that helps me stick to it and perform it in a better way.</p>
            </li>
